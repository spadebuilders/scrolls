# Purpose
To provide direction and process flow for knowledge management in the Ethereum ecosystem.
The three main directives will be to help with:
1. Educating ourselves (those currently in the Ethereum community)
2. Educating the rest of the world (either devs or non technical community)
3. How we bring devs to opensource (grow the technical engagement of Ethereum)

A goal of this ring would be to provide any necessary EIPs on Educational governance as well as overall direction for how to share knowledge and provide a better path towards technical  depth of knowledge of Ethereum.

# Problem Statements

* There currently isn't a good knowledge repository that provides a holistic perspective on Ethereum development (EF website is OK, but few people use this a resource to understand what Ethereum is and how to actually develop on it). How can we help define what is needed for this repository and build it?  
* How do we make onboarding into the Ethereum community fun & friendly? 
* How do we best manage these knowledge repositories moving forward – how to fund those initiatives and make them open to contributing?
