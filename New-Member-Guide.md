## Welcome to the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians!

This document is to guide you as you get started in community self-organizing.

To introduce ourselves, we are the Magicians, and you are probably a Magician too. It is a self-selected group. We are people in the community who are working to make Ethereum better. 

## The Rings

Often we work in teams called "Rings" to move Ethereum-related standards and practices forward, organize gatherings around the world, and provide education to new members like you.

Check out the [list of Rings](https://github.com/ethereum-magicians/scrolls/wiki#rings).

Think about which aspect of Ethereum you'd be interested in, whether contributing or learning. Which are often the same thing.

## Take Responsibility

One aspect of the Magicians to know about early-on is that no one is in charge. You can start a project, or get started on a project started by someone else. It is all up to you.

Each Ring has a Contact person. If you'd like to help out or learn more, please each out to the Contact on the [Magicians Forum](https://ethereum-magicians.org/)! There is no info desk yet but [jpitts](https://ethereum-magicians.org/u/jpitts), [bmann](https://ethereum-magicians.org/u/bmann), and [pet3rpan](https://ethereum-magicians.org/u/pet3rpan) can also help you.

## Gatherings

Keep up to date with what is happening via our EthMagicians [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/ethmagicians). 

Often Magicians Rings will gather at Ethereum-related events, definitely check out the Forum to see if one is coming to your city. Our [tri-annual Councils](https://ethereum-magicians.org/c/fellowship-gatherings/council-sessions) are especially important. Councils are where heavy-lifting on standards work happens in-person, and we often need a lot of help organizing those. Reach out to [tomislavmamic](https://ethereum-magicians.org/u/tomislavmamic/) to get involved with the Council of Paris 2019!

## Our Ethos

The Magicians are guided by a proposed [Mission, Principles, and Practices](https://github.com/ethereum-magicians/scrolls/wiki/Principles-of-the-Fellowship). Please read through that document!
