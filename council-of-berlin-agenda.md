# July 14th Saturday Day One

We had the Main room with projector and sound system, and the Side room around the corner. The Main room was a full coverage space, with livestream rolling the whole time and expectations that photos would be taken and posted. The Side room was meant to be a non-digital space, with Chatham house rules (quotes, but no attribution to the person). The Overflow was outside at the picnic tables.
