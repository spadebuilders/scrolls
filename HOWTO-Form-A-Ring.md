## Rings
Rings are the process in which we gather groups of individuals interested in collaborating together to document, interoperate, and advance standards around a particular focus. This gathers interested parties and experts in one place to move the creation of high-quality EIPs and implementation of running code.

These Rings can also be called upon to scale the Core Devs process, as it is understood that the necessary experts and interested parties have been gathered together and done work before approaching the Last Call process. Additionally, over time, high quality Rings can be called upon for comment or expertise, rather than all Core Devs needing to be experts in all topical areas.

## Guidelines 

Rings exist in two types:
 - Fields : Created to gather expertise and interested parties around a specific unifying Topic and designed to be non-expiring. (E.g. Wallets)
 - Working Groups : Created to address a specific problem or to produce one or more specific deliverables (a guideline, standards specification, etc.) and is ephemeral by design. (I.e. will desolve upon completion of its goals and achievement of its objectives.)

It is expected that membership intermingle among Fields and that from Fields Working groups be formed and reformed as needed. 

## Charter

The formation of a Ring requires a charter which may be renegotiated periodically to reflect the current status, organization or goals of the Ring. Specifically, each charter consists of the following sections:

#### Ring Name
A Ring's name should be reasonably descriptive or identifiable. Additionally, the group shall define an acronym (maximum 16 printable ASCII characters) to reference the group in the Ring directories, forums, and general documents.

#### Type
- [ ] Field
- [ ] Working Group

#### Lead/s
Leads are self selected and primary responible for admistration of the Ring on the Ethereum Magician's Forum. One or more are to be identified at the formation of a Ring and membership is expected to change overtime. No Ring should exist without a lead for a significant time. In the event that no volunteers step forward to become a Lead a Ring will be dematerialized. 

#### Magician's Forum URL
Central location where most of the work of a Ring will be conducted.
https://ethereum-magicians.org/c/working-groups/<name>

#### Membership Configuration Rules
Ring Leads are required to specifiy the configuration of groups within the Magician's Forum. The specified configuration, and any updates to it, are requested to be public. There are no requirements for a specific configuration. The possible options are as follows.

#### Ring Description
The focus and intent of the group shall be set forth briefly. By reading this section alone, an individual should be able to decide whether this group is relevant to their own work.

The first paragraph should give a brief summary of the problem area, basis, goal(s) and approach(es) planned for the working group. This paragraph can be used as an overview of the working group's effort.

#### Relevant EIPs
A list of current (if any) EIPs that are relevant to this Ring. EIPs may belong to one or more Rings and it is expected this list to be maintained and updated regularly.

## Membership Requirements

Following the creation of the Charter. Once one or more leads is identified and at least 3 members are interested (including the lead) in participating continue forming the Ring.

*reminder*
>There is no formal membership in the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians. Participation is open to all. This participation may be by on-line contribution, attendance at face-to-face sessions, or both. Anyone from the Internet community who has the time and interest is urged to participate in meetings and any of its on-line working group (Rings of both types) discussions. Participation is by individual technical contributors, rather than by formal representatives of organizations.

## Create a new wiki page called YOUR Ring

Model it after the [Ring Charter Template](Ring-Charter-Template). Link it to the front page of this wiki with a copy of your charter.

## Write a forum post announcing it

Post in the top of the [Rings category on the forum](https://ethereum-magicians.org/c/working-groups) inviting people to join / add themselves as participants to the wiki page

## Get a new category in the forum created for your Ring

[File an issue](https://github.com/ethereum-magicians/scrolls/issues/new) to ask this to get done.
