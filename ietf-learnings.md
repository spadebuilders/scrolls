Hello fellow magicians!

I've stumbled into an opportunity to discuss TCP/IP and RCFs with the chair of the IETF, [Alissa Cooper](https://www.ietf.org/blog/profile-alissa-cooper/).

The intention is to learn about what goes well during any IETF process, what are areas of improvement, and any recommendations to remedy pain points the IETF has run into. 

I'd like to collect a suite of questions that I can ask her during our call. Please add any questions you'd like answered below (with some context to ensure the question is asked properly). I will follow up post call and update with responses.
