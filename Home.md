# Purpose of this wiki

This wiki should be the archive of the ethereum magicans. So Magi interested in certain topics can get information without having to process tons of chat and forum text.

The [issues](https://github.com/ethereum-magicians/scrolls/issues) are also used mainly for infrastructure items and other actionable tasks.

The [projects](https://github.com/ethereum-magicians/scrolls/projects) can be used for high level planning of events.
