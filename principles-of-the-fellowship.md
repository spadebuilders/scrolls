# Towards a Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians

> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
> â€” Arthur C. Clarke

We propose to create a Fellowship to build awareness about changing and macro circumstances within which the Ethereum community can self-organize to maximize technical opportunities with the highest quality, share ideas and work together effectively, online and in person, across national, organizational and other boundaries in the shortest lead time.

## Fellowship Vision
- **The Goal:** To keep Ethereum The Best It Can Technically Be.
-  **The Mission:** To Nurture Community Consensus on the technical direction and specification of Ethereum. 
- **The Work** Primarily, high-quality Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), accepted by a consensus of the Community.

## Fellowship Principles

**Open Process.**  Any interested person can participate in the work, know what is being decided, and make his or her voice heard on the issue.

**Individual Participation.**  Membership is not formal.  We are a Fellowship of individuals rather than organizations, companies, governments or interest groups.

**Technical Responsibility.**  The Fellowship accepts responsibility for all aspects of the Ethereum protocol specification.  The Fellowship may take responsibility for related specifications proposed to it in the future.

**Technical Competence.**  The Fellowship seeks consensus on proposals where we have the necessary competence.  The Fellowship is willing to listen to technically competent input from any source.

**"Rough Consensus and Running Code."**  Consensus is not unanimity or majority vote.  Rather, it is based on the combined technical judgement of our participants and our real-world experience in implementing and deploying our specifications.

## Fellowship Practices

### Online Presence
- Curated web pages, including information about the Fellowship, a calendar of upcoming events, and links to useful resources.
- Accessible discussion forums, with at least a threaded web interface and email integration.

### In-Person Work

- Triannual meetings, two coordinated with Devcon and EthCC and one in July.
- Meetups, discussions, presentations, workshops, hackathons, and other relevant activities.  These can be organized by participants on an ad-hoc basis or with the sponsorship of the Fellowship.

### Iterative Workflow
- Participants do research, gain experience, present their work, and make proposals.
- Proposals are discussed and reworked, online and in person, until consensus is reached.
