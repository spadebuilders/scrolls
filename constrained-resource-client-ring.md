# Constrained Resource Client Ring Charter

### Ring Name

Constrained Resource Client

### Ring Description

There are many concurrent and disjoint efforts towards ultra-light clients for Ethereum, particularly to support mobile and in-browser wallets.

The purpose of this working group is to collect the stakeholders of these different efforts in one group and foster compatibility between them.

A catalogue of existing efforts to better cater in-browser and mobile wallets:
